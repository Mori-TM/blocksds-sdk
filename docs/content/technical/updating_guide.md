Newer BlocksDS versions occasionally introduce breaking changes which require
developer action, as well as non-breaking changes which developers are encouraged
to implement. These are documented here.

Please refer to the changelog for a full list of changes, including additions
and enhancements to the SDK which are not listed here.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.15.0

* The default makefiles of ARM9-only projects have switched to an ARM7 core that
  doesn't include DSWiFi because most projects don't need it, so it saves around
  40 KB of space in the NDS ROM of every other project.

  If you have copied the Makefile of the ARM9-only template to your own project,
  this doesn't affect you. It only affects you if you include the default
  makefile in your own makefile. In that case, you will need to add this line to
  go back to the previous core:

  ```
  ARM7ELF := $(BLOCKSDS)/sys/arm7/main_core/arm7_dswifi_maxmod.elf
  ```
* Field `rssi` of struct `Wifi_AccessPoint` is now signed instead of unsigned.
* Flag `WFLAG_APDATA_ADHOC` no longer works as ad hoc mode support has been
  removed (this is different from multiplayer mode, that's still supported).
  Field `macaddr` of struct `Wifi_AccessPoint` has been removed.
* Unused define `WFLAG_APDATA_SHORTPREAMBLE` has been removed.
* The strings of `ASSOCSTATUS_STRINGS` have been modified to make them useful.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.14.2

* ndstool now handles DSi title IDs and units codes differently. This shouldn't
  affect any regular user of BlocksDS, but it may be a problem in some unusual
  cases.

  The new default title ID is `0x00030004`, not `0x00030000`. Also, with
  previous versions, title ID `0x00030000` would set the unit code to 2 and
  other title IDs would set the unit code to 3. This isn't automatic anymore.

  Some examples if you want to preserve the old behaviour:

  - `ndstool` with no `-u` becomes `ndstool -u 00030000`
  - `ndstool -u 00030004` becomes `ndstool -uc 3`
  - `ndstool -u 0003000F` becomes `ndstool -u 0003000F -uc 3`

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.14.0

* `WiFi_Deinit()`, introduced in version 1.13.1, no longer works after starting
  DSWiFi with Internet mode enabled. This is due to limitations of lwIP, which
  can't be deinitialized.
* Applications using DSWiFi to connect to the Internet will now need to replace
  all calls to `swiWaitForVBlank()` by `cothread_yield_irq(IRQ_VBLANK)`. Any
  infinite loop reading from sockets or writing to them needs to call
  `cothread_yield()` at some point to give lwIP the chance to process packets.
  The changes are required because DSWiFi now relies on the multithreading code
  of libnds to work.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.13.1

* The function `Wifi_InitDefault()` of DSWiFi now takes an integer as an
  argument instead of a bool.  The new values passed to the function have been
  designed so that old code still works.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.8.0

* `ledBlink()` now takes an enum as an argument instead of an integer. In C++
   projects, this will cause an error until you add an explicit cast or you use
   one of the new defines.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.7.0

* `glColorTableEXT()` now supports allocating empty palettes by passing a
  `NULL` pointer in the `table` argument. This is a small compatibility break
  because this used to free the palette. However, the old behaviour stays as
  long as `width` is 0. In most cases, `table` would be NULL and `width` would
  be 0, so this change is only a problem in unusual cases.
* Upgrading from previous installations of BlocksDS requires running the
  following commands:

  ```bash
  wf-pacman -Sy wf-pacman
  wf-pacman -Syu
  wf-pacman -Syu
  ```

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.6.0

* The GRF format has been slightly modified. This has been done to add a version
  field to the header. The GRF functions of libnds have been updated as well as
  grit, so you will have to rebuild your GRF files and update any GRF loader
  that you have implemented.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.4.0

* Custom libnds keyboards now work. This seems to have never worked because
  libnds overwrote the custom keyboard struct with the default keyboard struct.
  Keyboard struct fields have been refactored. Some field sizes are now smaller,
  some fields are now const. The order has been changed to reduce padding
  between fields and save even more RAM. In order to see how to use custom
  keyboards, please, check the examples.
* Some fields of the `PrintConsole` have been modified to reduce the size of the
  struct. Please, check the examples to get more information.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.3.0

* General changes:

  * The `ConsoleFont` struct no longer takes a `convertSingleColor`
    argument.

    * It is recommended to instead provide 1bpp font tile data, which
      will be automatically unpacked to use color indices 0 and 15.
      To generate a 1bpp font, you can use grit with the `-gB1` argument;
      see [default_font.grit](https://github.com/blocksds/libnds/blob/f3b609b3099f256502cd241b8519ecc59e4f68a6/graphics/default_font.grit) for an example.
    * Alternatively, you can ensure that the font tiles use color indices
      0 and 15 (or 0 and 255 for 8bpp graphics) explicitly.

* ARM7-specific changes:

  * As these commands were only intended for TSC (NTR), `touchRead` and
    `touchReadTemperature` were moved to a new header, `tsc.h`, and renamed
    to `tscRead` and `tscReadTemperature` respectively.
  * In a similar fashion, `cdcTouchRead` is no longer available - it has
    been replaced by `cdcTouchReadData` which exposes all samples read;
    however, it is recommended to use `touchReadData` which supports both
    TSC (NTR) and CDC (TWL).
  * Some macro and function names have been changed:
    - `RTC_CR`, `RTC_CR8` and `HALT_CR` have been renamed to `REG_RTCCNT`,
      `REG_RTCCNT8` and `REG_HALTCNT`, respectively.
    - `SerialWaitBusy` has been renamed to `spiWaitBusy`.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.2.0

* The `SOUND_FREQ` (ARM7) and `TIMER_FREQ` macros have been reworked to
  provide the nearest frequency to the one requested by the user, rounded.
  This changes their returned values in some cases; you may want to validate
  your uses of these macros.
* In `gl2d.h`, `glLoadSpriteSet` now expects an array of `uint16_t` integers
  for texture coordinates, rather than 32-bit `unsigned int`s. This has been done
  to reduce memory waste, as the coordinates always fit in a 16-bit integer.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 1.0.0

* In `nds/bios.h`, the `PUnpackStruct` alias for `TUnpackStruct*` has been
  deprecated.
* In `nds/ndstypes.h`, the `fp` function pointer type has been deprecated.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 0.14.0

* The `nds/arm9/grf.h` GRF file loading functions introduced in BlocksDS 0.13.0
  have been replaced.
* The `libxm7` library now uses timer 0, matching `maxmod`.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 0.13.0

* Users are encouraged to use the new function `isHwDebugger()` over `swiIsDebugger()`
  to more accurately detect debug units.
* The GRF format used by Grit has been adjusted to properly follow the RIFF
  standard. As such, if your project relies on pre-generated GRF files, they may
  need to be regenerated.
* The Slot-2 tilt API introduced in BlocksDS 0.11.0 has been replaced.

### libnds touch screen and keyboard handling

`scanKeys()` updates the internal state of the key handling code. This is then
used by `keysHeld()` and `keysDown()`.

However, BlocksDS also requires the user to call `scanKeys()` before any of the
following functions: `touchRead()`, `keyboardGetChar()`, `keyboardUpdate()` and
the deprecated `touchReadXY()`.

This is unlikely to be a problem in most projects, as the normal thing to do is
to both scan the keys and read the touchscreen status, not just read the
touchscreen.

The reason is that the functions `scanKeys()` and `touchRead()` aren't
synchronized in any way, which creates a race condition. Consider this code:

```c
while (1)
{
    scanKeys();
    if (keysHeld() & KEY_TOUCH)
    {
        touchPosition touchPos;
        touchRead(&touchPos);
        printf("%d, %d\n", touchPos.px, touchPos.py);
    }
    swiWaitForVBlank();
}
```

The state of the X and Y buttons, as well as the state of the touch screen, is
passed from the ARM7 with a FIFO message. This message can technically happen in
between `scanKeys()` and `touchRead()`, which means that it's possible that
`keysHeld() & KEY_TOUCH` is true, but the coordinates read by `touchRead()` are
(0, 0) because the user has stopped pressing the screen right at that point, and
`scanKeys()` read the outdated values while `touchRead()` read the updated
values.

In BlocksDS, `scanKeys()` is used to latch the current state of the keys and the
touch screen. This forces the developer to call `scanKeys()`, but it also
ensures that there are no race conditions, as `scanKeys()` will read all the
state atomically.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 0.12.0

* In `readdir()`, `.` and `..` filesystem entries are now returned, both on
  FAT and NitroFS filesystems.

## Upgrading to BlocksDS 0.11.3

* If you were using the ndstool feature of adding alternate language banner text
  (added in BlocksDS 0.6), the argument syntax has changed from `-bt5 "Text"` to
  `-bt 5 "Text"`.
