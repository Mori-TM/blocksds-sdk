This is the easiest option, but you may not get the latest version of the SDK
right away.

1. You will also need to install the ARM toolchain of Wonderful Toolchains.
   Follow the instructions in this link:
   https://wonderful.asie.pl/docs/getting-started/#linux

1. Add the BlocksDS repository to `wf-pacman`:

   ```bash
   export PATH=/opt/wonderful/bin:$PATH

   wf-pacman -Syu wf-tools
   wf-config repo enable blocksds
   wf-pacman -Syu
   ```

1. Now, install the ARM toolchain of Wonderful Toolchains, as well as BlocksDS:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S blocksds-toolchain
   ```

   To install the documentation and examples you can install:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S blocksds-docs
   ```

   Install the following if you plan to develop binaries for the DSP of the DSi:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S toolchain-llvm-teak-llvm
   ```

1. (Optional step) You can also install some third party libraries like
   [NightFoxâ€™s Lib](https://github.com/knightfox75/nds_nflib) and
   [Nitro Engine](https://github.com/AntonioND/nitro-engine) using
   `wf-pacman`:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S blocksds-nflib blocksds-nitroengine
   ```

   You can get a full list of packages by running:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -Sl
   ```

1. `wf-pacman` installs BlocksDS in `/opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/`.
   This isn't the standard location (`wf-pacman` can only write files to
   `/opt/wonderful/`) so you need to do one of the two following options:

   1. Create a symlink (note that this doesn't work with MinGW):

      ```bash
      ln -s /opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds /opt/blocksds
      ```

   1. Set your environment variables correctly:

      ```bash
      source /opt/wonderful/bin/wf-env
      ```

      You can do it manually instead if you prefer:

      ```bash
      export BLOCKSDS=/opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/core
      export BLOCKSDSEXT=/opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/external
      ```

1. Whenever you need to update the SDK, run:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -Syu
   ```

1. Now you can try to build one of the BlocksDS examples. From the shell, run:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/core/examples/
   ```

   From there, for example, go to `graphics_3d/volumetric_shadow` and type
   `make`. This will generate a NDS ROM that you can try with an emulator or a
   flashcart.

   You can also try one of the open source projects made with BlocksDS that are
   listed [here](https://github.com/blocksds/awesome-blocksds).

   If you get an error like "command not found: make", you need to install it
   from the packages of your system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential
   ```

   If you want to know how to debug your programs, check the guide
   [here](../../../usage/debugging).
